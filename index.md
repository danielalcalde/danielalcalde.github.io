## About me
I had many interests that came and went throughout my life, but physics and programming are two long passions of mine that stayed throughout the years. I persued my interest in physics at the Ruhr Universität Bochum where I finished a Bachelor and Master degrees in physics with a focus on computational solid state Physics and Machine Learning. During this time, I fell in love with python and used it not only for my Masters thesis but also during my free time for small projects - from programming an Alexa skill to analyzing covid-19 infection data. 
  
I am currently working as Ph.D. student at the Forschungzentrum Jülich and the University of Cologne with [Matteo Rizzi](http://www.thp.uni-koeln.de/rizzi/index.html).

## Master Thesis
During my studies, I developed an interest in Machine Learning which I strengthened through finishing relevant courses in the Neuroinformatics department at the RUB. When it was time to do my Master Thesis, I already had some experience with Monte Carlo simulations in the context of the Langevine equation for stochastic quantization and had played around with Restricted Boltzmann Machines for another class. After searching I found out that RBMs where being used to speed up Monte Carlo simulations and thought that a convolutional RBM, being translationally invariant would work better since many physical models are translationally invariant. I suggested this topic to my supervisor Prof. I. Eremin and was glad when he accepted it for a master’s thesis. During the master thesis, I learned how to research and specifically I learned how to run reproducible computational experiments for which I made a small python program called encapsulate. I also learned how to keep up with the growing literature in the field.

[*"Analysis of the Ising and Kitaev Model Using the CRBM Aided Monte Carlo Method"*](files/Master-Thesis-Daniel-Alcalde-Puente.pdf) is my master thesis, which I completed in the Ruhr Universität Bochum. A shortened and improved version of chapter 4, 5 can be found in preprint [1]. Chapter 6 remains unpublished. The main ideas can be explored in this [Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/danielalcalde/MCMC_CRBM/blob/master/Ising_CRBM.ipynb).
